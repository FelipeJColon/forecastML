\title{Combine multiple horizon-specific forecast models to produce one forecast}
\usage{
combine_forecasts(..., type = c("horizon", "error"),
  data_error = list(NULL))
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{One or more objects of class 'forecast_results' from running \code{predict.forecast_model()} on
an input forward-looking forecast dataset. These are the forecasts from the horizon-specific
direct forecasting models trained over the entire training dataset by setting \code{create_windows(..., window_length = 0)}.
If \code{type = 'horizon'}, 1 final h-step-ahead forecast is returned for each model passed in \code{...}.}

\item{type}{A character vector of length 1 that identifies the forecast combination method.}

\item{data_error}{Not implemented at present.}
}
\value{
An S3 object of class 'forecastML' with final h-step-ahead forecasts.

   \strong{Columns in returned 'forecastML' data.frame:}
    \itemize{
      \item \code{model}: User-supplied model name in \code{train_model()}.
      \item \code{model_forecast_horizon}: The direct-forecasting time horizon that the model was trained on.
      \item \code{horizon}: Forecast horizons, 1:h, measured in dataset rows.
      \item \code{forecast_period}: The forecast period in row indices or dates. The forecast period starts at either \code{attributes(create_lagged_df())$data_stop + 1} for row indices or \code{attributes(create_lagged_df())$data_stop + 1 * frequency} for date indices.
      \item \code{"groups"}: If given, the user-supplied groups in \code{create_lagged_df()}.
      \item \code{"outcome_name"_pred}: The final forecasts.
      \item \code{"outcome_name"_pred_lower}: If given, the lower forecast bounds returned by the user-supplied prediction function.
      \item \code{"outcome_name"_pred_upper}: If given, the upper forecast bounds returned by the user-supplied prediction function.
   }

\description{
The horizon-specific models can either be combined to (a) produce final forecasts for only those
horizons at which they were trained (i.e., shorter-horizon models override longer-horizon models
when producing final short-horizon h-step-ahead forecasts) or (b) produce final forecasts using
any combination of horizon-specific models that minimized error over the validation/training dataset or
a holdout test dataset.
